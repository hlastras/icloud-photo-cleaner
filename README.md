# iCloud Photo Cleaner

## Introduction
`icloud-photo-cleaner` is designed to simplify the task of managing and cleaning up your iCloud photo library. When thousands of photos accumulate in your phone's gallery, it becomes a daunting task to go through each one individually to decide whether to keep it or delete it. This tool enhances the process by displaying photos from the selected album one by one on your screen. Users can either keep the photo and move to the next by pressing the right arrow key, or delete the photo and proceed to the next by pressing the 'D' key. To minimize mistakes, a backup copy of each photo is saved in the specified folder before deletion. Although it still requires effort to review each photo individually, this tool makes the process more manageable with just two keystrokes, especially when dealing with large volumes, such as 15,000 photos.
